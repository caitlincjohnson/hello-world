# hello-world
A repository used to maintain and store early concepts and random ideas.

Hello all,

My name is Caitlin and I'm a bit new to GitHub. I was taking some Android development courses on Udacity when I realized that it would be a good idea to showcase some of my projects.
I will be using this repository to store conceptual ideas and random projects completed during my online courses.
